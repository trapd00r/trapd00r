Hi, I'm japh.

A perl hacker that's passionate about open source, cli tools, linux.


I write programs that handle text streams, because that is a universal interface. I admire people who do the same.

Therefore Vim is a huge part of my life, and I use it for pretty much anything and everything.



Care for a chat about anything interesting?

Give me a shout at irc.libera.chat ; #perl, #vim, #mpd
